            Hi! My name is I Made Putra Sedana, and I&apos;m a passionate web
            developer based in Bali. My journey into web development began with
            curiosity and a strong desire to create and build things for the
            web. I&apos;ve been learning through various online platforms,
            including YouTube tutorials, documentation, FreeCodeCamp, and
            Dicoding Academy.

            Currently, I&apos;m a sixth-semester student at Primakara
            University, majoring in Information Systems. Throughout my studies,
            I&apos;ve gained a solid foundation in programming, covering topics
            such as Data Structures & Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming,
            and Database Fundamentals.
          </p>
          <p className=" mb-4 text-justify">
            Beyond web development, I&apos;m also fascinated by how AI can
            enhance programming, making it more efficient and innovative.
            I&apos;m excited to explore how AI tools can streamline development
            and shape the future of technology.
